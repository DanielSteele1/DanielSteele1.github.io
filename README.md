## ⚠️This website has been replaced!⚠️
A new and improved portolio has replaced this one, and this Repo now serves as a showcase of how much my skills have evolved over the last 6-12 months.
It's cleaner, more modular & includes a much more modern design than this version. It includes a personal/technical blog, uses TS and is ugraded from CRA to Vite in order to provide a faster UX.
